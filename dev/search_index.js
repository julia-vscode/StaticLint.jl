These are achieved through a single pass over the ST of a project. A pass over a single EXPR is achieved through calling a State object on the ST. This State requires an AbstractServer that determines how files within a project are loaded and makes packages available for loading.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Passes","page":"Home","title":"Passes","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"For a given experssion x this pass will:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"Handle import statements (resolve_import). This either explicitly imports variables into the current state (for statements such as import/using SomeModule: binding1, binding2) or makes the exported bindings of a modules available more generally (e.g. using SomeOtherModule). The availability of includable packages is handled by the getsymbolserver function called on the state.server.\nDetermine whether x introduces a new variable. mark_bindings! performs this and may mark bindings for child nodes of x (e.g. when called on an expression that defines a Function this will mark the arguments of the signature as introducing bindings.)\nAdds any binding associated with x to the variable list of the current scope (add_binding).\nHandles global variables (mark_globals).\nSpecial handling for macros introducing new bindings as necessary, at the moment limited to deprecate, enum, goto, label, and nospecialize.\nAdds new scopes for the interior of x as needed (scopes).\nResolves references for identifiers (i.e. a variable name), macro name, keywords in function signatures and dotted names (e.g. A.B.c). A name is first checked against bindings introduced within a scope then against exported variables of modules loaded into the scope. If this fails to resolve the name this is repeated for the parent scope. References that fail to resolve at this point, and are within a delayed scope (i.e. within a function) are added to a list to be resolved later.\nIf x is a call to include(path_expr) attempt to resolve path_expr to a loadable file from state.server and pass across the files ST (followinclude).\nTraverse across child nodes of x (traverse) in execution order. This means, for example, that in the expression a = b we traverse b then a (ignoring the operator).","category":"page"},{"location":"#Server","page":"Home","title":"Server","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"As mentioned, an AbstractServer is required to hold files within a project and provide access to user installed packages.
